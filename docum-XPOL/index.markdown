# 1. Files associated to audit defects

When creating new audits, new files associated with the defects can be attached, which can later be viewed from different screens. <br>
Files can only be attached and deleted from the “Data Entry” screen. From the rest of the screens they can only be consulted. <br>
This new change affects the following screens: <br>

> **Audits &gt; Data entry**: Possibility of associating new
> files and delete them. <br>
> **Audits &gt; Audit history**: Consultation only.<br>
> **Defect Reports &gt; Defect Report Management**: Consultation only.<br>
> **Defect Reports &gt; One Pager Meetings**: Consultation only.

## 1.1 Introduction to audits data

The new files can be associated with the audit defects from this screen. Like the audit images, files of the following types can be introduced:
<ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Videos</li>
    <li>Audios</li>
    <li>Documents</li>
</ul>
Each type of file will be distributed in different tabs.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen1.png" ></center>
<center>Image 1, files associated to the audit defects.</center>

All files can be deleted from “Data Entry” at any time. <br>
From any of the different tabs you can attach several files at the same time, that is, it is not necessary to upload them one at a time. If the file limit is exceeded, a message will be displayed and only the maximum number of files allowed will be attached.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen2.png" ></center>
<center>Image 2, file limit exceed.</center>

### 1.1.1 Image defect 
The first "Image Defect” does not change in its operation or functionality. In it you can attach temporary images that are used to create a collage. The final image is the **main image** associated with the defect that will continue to be displayed in all reports.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen3.png" ></center>
<center>Image 3,images of an audit defect to generate the main image.</center>

When an audit is completed, the temporary images uploaded to this tab are deleted and only the main image of the defect is stored.
New attachments will not be deleted upon completion of the audit.

### 1.1.2 Image Defects 
Images attached to this tab are not deleted upon completion of the audit.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen4.png" ></center>
<center>Image 4, images of an audit defect.</center>

<ul>
    <li>Supported formats: <strong>JPG, PNG, GIF.</strong></li>
    <li>Maximun size: <strong>5MB</strong>.</li>
    <li>Limit of images to attach:<strong> 5</strong>.</li>
</ul>

By clicking on the image it can be viewed in a larger size.

### 1.1.3 Vídeos
Above the video the full name is shown with extension and size in parentheses.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen5.png" ></center>
<center>Image 5, video of an audit defect.</center>

<ul>
    <li>Video: <strong>MP4, MOV.</strong></li>
    <li>Maximun size:  <strong>10MB</strong>.</li>
    <li>Limit of videos to attach:<strong> 3</strong>.</li>
</ul>

The video can be played in the videos tab itself by pressing the play button shown in each of the attached videos. <br>
<center><img src="./Imagenes/play.png" ></center>

During video playback, if you click on the video, it will play at its original size outside the videos tab.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen6.png" ></center>
<center>Image 6, video of an audit defect.</center>


If it is played outside the videos tab, you can move the video around the screen, positioning it wherever you want.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen7.png" ></center>
<center>Image 7, playing a video of an audit defect.</center>

At the bottom of each video are the controls to stop playback, mute, show full screen or three dots with different options.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen8.png" ></center>
<center>Image 8, playing a video of an audit defect.</center>

<ul>
    <li><img src = "./Imagenes/Pausar.png"> Stop</li>
    <li><img src = "./Imagenes/Silenciar.png"> Silence</li>
    <li><img src = "./Imagenes/pantalla.png"> Full Screen</li>
</ul>

If we click on the 3 points on the right, it presents us with the following options:
<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen9.png" ></center>
<center>Image 9, audit defect video controls.</center>

The options it gives us are to download the video to our local drive, modify the playback speed and the option to view the video embedded in the tab or outside of it. <br>
Playback speed options:

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen10.png" ></center>
<center>Image 10, default video speed options of an audit.</center>

### 1.1.4 Audios

The full name with extension and size in parentheses is shown above the audio.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen11.png" ></center>
<center>Image 11, audio of the audit defect.</center>

<ul>

    <li>Maximun size: <strong> 10MB</strong>.</li>
    <li>Limit of audios to attach: <strong> 3</strong>.</li>
</ul>

By clicking on the three dots on the right of the player, the following options are shown:

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen12.png"></center>
<center> Image 12, audit defect audio options.</center>

In this way you can download the audio to your local disk and modify the sound playback speed.

### 1.1.5 Documents

The full name with extension and size in parentheses is shown above the document.
<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen13.png"></center>
<center>Image 13, documents of the audit defects.</center>

    <li>Limit of images to attach: <strong> 5</strong>.</li>
</ul>

By clicking on each document you can view it.

## 1.2 History of the audited vehicles

From the history of audited vehicles, by editing the audits, all the files attached to their defects can be consulted. To do this, you must edit the selected defect.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen14.png"></center>
<center>Image 14, defects of an audit defect.</center>

At the bottom, all the files attached from data entry are shown, but only in query mode. That is, from this screen you cannot attach new files or delete existing ones.

The system to play these files is the same as in the previous point.

<center>Image 18, audio associated with an audit defect.</center>

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen19.png"></center>
<center>Image 19, documents associated with an audit defect.</center>

## 1.3 Defect Report Management
If the audit defect has associated defect reports, all attached files will be displayed in query mode at the bottom of the defect report management screen. <br>
Both the audit files and the presentation files will be displayed if the defect report is associated with a presentation.

<center><img src="./Imagenes/Imagen20.png"></center>
<center>Image 20, defect report.</center>


## 1.4 Presentations One Pager Meetings

From the “One Pager Meetings” presentation screen, if the audit is unfinished, a provisional defect report can be created and the block of audit files will be displayed in query mode on the presentation screen.

The first attachments tab in which the defect image is displayed is not displayed on this screen as the defect image is displayed large at the top.
